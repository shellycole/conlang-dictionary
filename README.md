# conlang-dictionary
Database dictionary for conlangers.

This is VERY new, and still needs a lot of work. I am only placing it here because I've had a few people express quite a bit of interest in it, and want to help with it. 

More information will be coming soon.

If you're interested in helping, please note that this is for a localhost installation of PHP and MySQL. It is NOT recommended for a live server at this time. If you put it on a live server, you do so at your own risk.

#### To-Do's
* Finish separating code properly into organized chunks
* Add configuration settings for the database connection
* Add in code to create a database that uses the connection settings
* Create an initial word list of the most common English words for ready translation
* Add in ability to use one database for several languages (currently it only supports one)
* Add in section for usage notes (such as pronunciation guides, grammar guides, etc.)
* Write translator (English-to-Conlang)
* Someday, add languages other than English (for example, French-to-Conlang, or Swedish-to-Conlang, because some of us are aware that not everyone speaks English)
* Write some good documentation
