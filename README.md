# conlang-dictionary
Database dictionary for conlangers.

This is VERY new, and still needs a lot of work. I am only placing it here because I've had a few people express quite a bit of interest in it, and want to help with it. 

More information will be coming soon.

If you're interested in helping, please note that this is for a localhost installation of PHP and MySQL. It is NOT recommended for a live server at this time. If you put it on a live server, you do so at your own risk.
