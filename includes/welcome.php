    <p>Welcome to your dictionary manager.</p>

    <p>I'm trying to keep this as simple as possible - I'm a believer in the KISS principle. I've included a library of the 3,000 most often used English words (US spelling, I'm afraid - sorry Canada and UK). 3,000 words seems a reasonable amount to create a solid language to build with, but you are absolutely able to add, edit, and delete from the pre-existing library. You may do so by clicking the "Add a Word" link up there at the top.</p>

    <p>You may view and search the existing library by clicking the "Word List" link at the top of the page. The "Resources" link will provide you a list of external pages which I, as a novice conlanger, have found very useful in language creation.</p>

    <p>Currently, this is where I am at with this software. I have further plans to improve and add to it as follows:
    	<ol>
    		<li>Add in the ability to create a new library for additional languages. Currently, this system only works for a single conlang. A new installation and database is required for each additional language.</li>
    		<li>Add in a simple translation system. Languages are complex, and since these are constructed languages, there is no possible way for me to predict what your grammar rules will be, so they will be simple word replacements. You will have to "grammarize" these sentences yourself - although someday (if there is actual interest in this software) it would be neat to have a section devoted to the grammatical rules you create so these translations would be spot on when you make your translations.</li>
    		<li>Add in the ability to upload your own font and stylesheet directly from this software. Currently you <em>can</em> do this, but it has to be manually completed, and you need to have some knowledge of FTP and CSS to pull it off.</li>
    		<li>Add in a base library for different "mother tongue" languages. Unfortunately, I'm an American (as in "USA", not Canadian), so you have spelling like "color" instead of "colour", and I am well aware that there are many other languages spoken in this world. Sadly, I don't know any of them, except for French, and it's been years since I've reliably spoken it. But any assistance in adding other base language libraries would be excellent, and very much appreciated.</li>
    	</ol>
    </p>

    <p>This is an initial release of this software. It will vailable on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>, so if you're into programming with MySQL and PHP, and have a github account, please feel free to contact me about joining me in making improvments to this.</p>

    <p>If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions on this software, you can contact me in several ways, all of which are linked in the bottom of every page.</p>
